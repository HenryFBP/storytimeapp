Angular has a couple main things 
- component 
- services 
- pipes
- directives
- the idea of modules 

Two types of components ideas
- container -> smart, aware of state... etc
- dumb -> purely presentational 

Services 
- should handle the business logic of  component or the communication to the state management service 

So communication from component to the state management service like a bridge 

Pipes 
- are used to convert data to a different type 

Directives 
Ehhh I have used it much 
- it like creating custom HTML attributes like the “ng-if” functionality 

Modules
- similar to the idea of micro services 

- modules should be isolated, independent, decoupled in the sense that it should depend on another module to operated 
- modules are distinct features
- ppl call them feature modules



Then typescript had a couple ideas
- Enums
- Interfaces/type 
- classes
